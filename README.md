# electrum ravencoin-lite

# RavencoinLite coin project was not interested in running an electrumX-server for ravencoinLite this project is semi functional I *DID* NOT finish the electrumX server side for electrum-ravencoinLite since they werent sure about hosting an electrumX style wallet for their coin project

# i built an electrum style wallet for UraniumX coin project which is actively hosted on an electrumX server that I am running
# see another heavy electrum modification similar to my coin running electrum-radiocoin for UraniumX here https://github.com/c4pt000/electrum-uraniumx
